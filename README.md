# Data-Professional-Survey
This project explores insights from a survey of data professionals. Using Power BI, I transformed and visualized the data to answer key questions about job satisfaction, demographics, and career challenges in the field of data science and analytics. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to analyze trends and make data-driven decisions.
